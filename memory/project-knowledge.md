## Technical Pitfalls

### Quick Action ID collision in companion-client.ts
- `Object.assign(msg, params)` would overwrite `msg.id` with `params.id` (actionId), causing request/response ID mismatch and timeout
- Fix: renamed to `actionId` field in params

### systray2 `update-menu` does NOT refresh `internalIdMap`
- `systray2` builds `internalIdMap` once at init (mapping `__id` → MenuItem). Calling `sendAction({ type: "update-menu" })` updates the visible menu but **leaves the internal map stale**
- When menu structure changes (e.g. Quick Actions count varies), subsequent clicks return stale `__id`s, causing clicks to map to the **wrong action** (e.g. clicking "Settings" triggers a Quick Action)
- Fix: kill + recreate the tray instance on every rebuild instead of using `update-menu`

### Chrome extension `thread.delete` field name mismatch
- Frontend (`ThreadList.tsx`) sends `thread_id` (snake_case) but `background/index.ts` reads `message.threadId` (camelCase)
- Result: companion receives `undefined` thread_id, deletion never executes
- Fix: read `message.thread_id || message.threadId` in background for backward compatibility

## Reusable Patterns

### Broadcast pattern for cross-client actions
- When tray triggers an action that should execute in the Chrome extension, companion creates the entity then **broadcasts** a start message to ALL WebSocket clients
- The extension picks it up and initiates its own request through its connection, so streaming flows naturally
- Avoids needing to modify the chat/streaming pipeline to support cross-client routing
- Files: server.ts `broadcast` fn → message-router.ts broadcasts `quickAction.start` → extension forwards to sidepanel → sidepanel sends `chat.send` through its own WS connection

## Architecture Decisions

### Quick Actions: delegation vs direct execution (2026-06-09)
- **Decision**: Quick actions from tray no longer execute tools directly; instead they create a thread and broadcast to the extension, which starts a normal chat
- **Why**: Previous direct execution + result server approach was fragile and all actions were failing. Delegating to the extension leverages the existing chat pipeline (streaming, tool calling, error handling) and displays results naturally in the Side Panel
- **Tradeoff**: Requires Chrome extension to be connected; no offline/standalone quick actions
